# CLAUDE.md — aiframework

**Source of truth for Claude Code in this repository.**
**Update this file after significant decisions, bug fixes, or architectural changes.**

**Last updated: 2026-04-16**

## When to Read Which Doc

| You need to... | Read |
|----------------|------|
| Understand how to work in this repo | This file (CLAUDE.md) |
| Debug a recurring issue | `docs/LESSONS_LEARNED.md` (if exists) |
| Find documentation | `docs/` |

---

## Decision Priority

When instructions conflict, follow this order:
1. **User's explicit instruction** in the current conversation
2. **Invariants** (below) — these are never overridden
3. **Workflow Rules** (below) — process guardrails
4. **Core Principles** (below) — design philosophy
5. **Reference docs** (\`docs/\`) — context, but code is always the source of truth

When determining system behavior (API shapes, data flow, field names):
1. **Read the code** — schemas, route handlers, models are the source of truth
2. **Verified external docs** — official API docs, confirmed library behavior
3. **Assume nothing** — if you can't verify it, say so

---

## Workflow Rules

### 1. Plan vs Execute
- Enter plan mode for ANY non-trivial task (3+ steps or architectural decisions)
- If something goes sideways, STOP and re-plan — don't keep pushing
- When given a task with clear scope: start executing immediately
- When hitting a wall (3+ failed attempts), stop and re-plan approach

### 2. Autonomous Iteration
- Execute fix → verify with tests → if broken, fix again → loop until clean
- Iterate autonomously: don't ask for hand-holding on fixable issues
- Commit after each logical group of verified fixes

### 3. Verification Before Done
- Never mark a task complete without proving it works
- Run verification commands (Stage 4) — never assume it compiles
- Never claim "done" without running the actual verification command

### 4. Git Safety
- After fixes: \`git add\` + \`git commit\` — but do NOT push until user says so
- NEVER push to main without explicit user confirmation
- NEVER commit after every small change — batch related changes into logical commits
- Prefer fewer, larger commits over many small ones

### 5. Subagent Strategy
- Use subagents for research, exploration, and parallel analysis
- Limit to 6-8 agents per wave maximum
- After each wave: summarize results, commit, then start next wave
- Use \`/compact\` after each major milestone to maintain headroom

### 6. QA Auto-Fix
When QA discovers issues, ALL must be automatically fixed:
1. Run tests — collect all failures
2. Fix each failure: identify root cause → fix implementation (never skip a test)
3. Run type check → must pass
4. Run tests again — all must pass
5. Commit

### 7. Documentation Auto-Sync
After ANY feature implementation, refactor, or significant change — before marking complete:
1. CLAUDE.md — if change adds invariants, new key locations, new commands
2. docs/ — update relevant doc files

### 8. Changelog Update
After marking any feature complete and before pushing:
1. Update CHANGELOG.md with user-facing description of changes
2. Bump VERSION file (PATCH for fixes, MINOR for features, MAJOR for breaking changes)

### 9. CLAUDE.md Auto-Evolution
This file is a living document that grows with the project. After ANY session with code changes:
- **New service/module added** → add to Key Locations
- **New env var added** → add to Environment Variables table
- **Non-obvious bug fixed** → add to Session Learnings via \`/learn\`
- **New invariant discovered** → add to Invariants section
- **Structural change** → update Project Structure
- NEVER delete content — only add, refine, or mark as deprecated

### 10. New Feature Checklist
Before marking any new feature complete, verify ALL applicable items:
- [ ] Feature works as specified
- [ ] Edge cases handled
- [ ] Error states covered
- [ ] Tests added for new functionality
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed
- [ ] No regressions in existing functionality

## Autonomous Pipeline (12 Stages)

### Stage 1: INVESTIGATE (before writing any code)
When: User reports a bug or asks to fix something.
```
/investigate "description of the issue"
```

### Stage 2: PLAN (before major features)
When: User asks for a significant feature or architectural change.
```
/plan-eng-review "description of the feature"
```

### Stage 3: BUILD (write the code)
Rules: No secrets in code — use environment variables.

### Stage 4: VERIFY (after every code change — ALWAYS)
```bash
find . -name '*.sh' -not -path '*/.git/*' -not -path '*/vault/*' | xargs shellcheck              # Must pass with 0 errors
find . -name '*.sh' -not -path '*/.git/*' -not -path '*/vault/*' | xargs bash -n         # Must pass
```

> Run `vault/.vault/scripts/vault-tools.sh lint` to verify vault integrity.

### Stage 5: REVIEW
```
/review
```

### Stage 6: SECURITY (when touching auth/security/API)
```
/cso
```

### Stage 6.5: CHANGELOG UPDATE
After completing any feature, fix, or significant change:
1. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with user-facing description
2. Bump `VERSION` file (PATCH for fixes, MINOR for features, MAJOR for breaking)
3. Commit changelog + version bump with the feature commit

### Stage 7: DOCS (after structural changes)
Run doc-sync check against this matrix:

| Change Type | Files to Update |
|-------------|----------------|
| New endpoint/route | CLAUDE.md (Key Locations), API docs |
| New env variable | CLAUDE.md (Env Variables), .env.example |
| New invariant | CLAUDE.md (Invariants) |
| Schema change | CLAUDE.md (Key Locations), migration docs |
| New dependency | CLAUDE.md (Project Identity), package manifest |
| New service/module | CLAUDE.md (Key Locations, Project Structure) |
| Architectural change | `docs/` architecture docs |

### Stage 8: QA (before every deploy)
```
/qa
```

### Stage 9: SHIP
```
/ship
```

### Stage 10: POST-DEPLOY
```
/canary
```

### Stage 11: LEARN
```
/learn "description of what was learned"
```

### Stage 12: RETRO (weekly)
```
/retro
```

## Skill Routing Table

| User says something like... | Claude's action |
|-----------------------------|----------------|
| "there's a bug", "it's broken", "fix this" | Start with `/investigate` before coding |
| "add feature", "build X" (big scope) | `/plan-eng-review` then build |
| "add feature", "change X" (small, clear) | Build directly, then verify + `/review` |
| "check security", "audit" | Run `/cso` immediately |
| "review the code", "check quality" | Run `/review` immediately |
| "test the app", "QA", "does it work" | Run `/qa` on the app URL |
| "deploy", "push", "ship it", "create PR" | Full pipeline: verify → `/review` → `/cso` → `/qa` → `/ship` |
| "what do we know about X", "previous decisions" | Check vault: `vault/wiki/index.md` and `vault/memory/decisions/` |
| "vault health", "check vault" | Run `vault/.vault/scripts/vault-tools.sh doctor` |

---

## End-of-Session Checklist

## Doc-Sync Matrix

| Domain | Key Files | Doc Impact |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| Database & Data Layer | vault/templates/entity-page.md | CLAUDE.md, docs/ |
| AI/LLM Integration | tools/learnings/aiframework-learnings.jsonl, tools/review-specialists/ai-llm.md | CLAUDE.md, docs/ |

When any file in a domain's key files changes, update the corresponding docs.

---

## Persistent Memory Vault

Your knowledge persists across sessions in `vault/`. Three-layer architecture:

| Layer | Path | Purpose | Lifetime |
|-------|------|---------|----------|
| **Raw** | `vault/raw/` | Immutable source documents (human-owned) | Permanent |
| **Wiki** | `vault/wiki/` | Processed knowledge (concepts, entities, comparisons) | Long-lived |
| **Memory** | `vault/memory/` | Operational state (decisions, notes, status) | Variable |

**Data flow:** `raw/` → `wiki/` → `memory/` (strictly unidirectional)

### Quick Commands

```bash
vault/.vault/scripts/vault-tools.sh status       # Vault health
vault/.vault/scripts/vault-tools.sh doctor        # Full diagnostic
vault/.vault/scripts/vault-tools.sh lint          # Quality scan
vault/.vault/scripts/vault-tools.sh stale         # Find outdated content
vault/.vault/scripts/vault-tools.sh orphans       # Find unlinked pages
vault/.vault/scripts/vault-tools.sh stats         # Usage metrics
```

### How to Use

- **Session START**: Read `vault/memory/status.md` for ongoing work context
- **During work**: Save insights to `vault/memory/notes/` (auto-archive after 7 days)
- **Significant decisions**: Log to `vault/memory/decisions/` using ADR format
- **Session END**: Update `vault/memory/status.md` with progress
- **New knowledge**: Create wiki pages in `vault/wiki/concepts/` or `vault/wiki/entities/`

### Architecture

See `vault/docs/architecture.md` for the full three-layer model.
See `vault/.vault/rules/hard-rules.md` for 15 integrity rules enforced by pre-commit hooks.

---

## Session Learnings

Stored in `tools/learnings/aiframework-learnings.jsonl`. Use `/learn` to add new entries.

*Learnings accumulate over time. After fixing a non-obvious bug or discovering a gotcha, run `/aif-learn` to capture it.*

### Learnings Format (JSONL)

Each line in the learnings file is a JSON object:
```json
{"date": "2026-04-15", "category": "bug|gotcha|pattern|decision", "summary": "One-line summary", "detail": "Full explanation", "files": ["path/to/relevant/file"]}
```

To query: `grep "keyword" tools/learnings/aiframework-learnings.jsonl`
To add: `/aif-learn "description"` or append a JSON line manually.

---

## gstack Browser Integration

If gstack is installed (`~/.claude/skills/gstack/`), use `$B` commands for browser interactions:
- `$B` is ~20x faster than Playwright MCP (~100ms vs ~2-5s)
- Uses ref-based element selection (`@e1`, `@e2`) instead of CSS selectors
- Persistent Chromium daemon — cookies/tabs/login persist between commands

### Command Reference

| Command | Usage | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| `goto` | `$B goto <url>` | Navigate to a URL |
| `snapshot` | `$B snapshot` | Get page structure with element refs |
| `click` | `$B click @e1` | Click an element by ref |
| `fill` | `$B fill @e1 "text"` | Fill an input field |
| `screenshot` | `$B screenshot` | Capture a screenshot |
| `console` | `$B console` | Read browser console logs |
| `network` | `$B network` | Read network requests/responses |
| `text` | `$B text @e1` | Get text content of an element |
| `html` | `$B html @e1` | Get HTML content of an element |
| `responsive` | `$B responsive <width>` | Set viewport width for responsive testing |
| `diff` | `$B diff` | Compare current page with previous snapshot |
| `chain` | `$B chain "click @e1" "fill @e2 text" "screenshot"` | Chain multiple commands |

---

## Session Start Protocol

At the start of each session:
1. Read `vault/memory/status.md` — check for ongoing work and operational context
2. Read `vault/wiki/index.md` — scan domain concepts and knowledge pages
3. Read `tools/learnings/aiframework-learnings.jsonl` — surface relevant learnings
4. Check `git log --oneline -10` — understand recent work
5. Check `git status` — understand current state
6. If a STATUS.md file exists — read it for multi-phase task progress
7. Decision Priority: User > Invariants > Workflow Rules > Core Principles > Docs
